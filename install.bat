REM Kandinsky UI one-click installer for Windows.
REM
REM Python is INCLUDED in this package, in the python_embeded folder,
REM Python 3.12, ComfyUI portable style. There is nothing to install
REM first, no venv is created, and no Python on your system is
REM touched or needed -- if you have no Python at all, this still
REM works.
REM
REM What it does:
REM   1. Bootstraps pip into the bundled Python, first run only,
REM      using the bundled get-pip.py.
REM   2. Installs PyTorch with CUDA support, needs an NVIDIA GPU and
REM      a recent driver, and the rest of the requirements, into
REM      python_embeded\Lib\site-packages.
REM   3. Creates images_out\ for finished pictures.
REM
REM What it does NOT do:
REM   - Download the Kandinsky model weights. Diffusers downloads the
REM     prior and decoder, about 8-12 GB total, from Hugging Face on
REM     the first Generate, into the Hugging Face cache on your user
REM     profile -- not into this folder.
REM
REM Requirements: Windows, an NVIDIA GPU, 12 GB recommended, about
REM 20 GB free disk. Everything here is free -- no account, no
REM payment, no server.
