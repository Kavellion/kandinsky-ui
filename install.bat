@echo off
REM Kandinsky UI one-click installer (Windows).
REM
REM What it does:
REM   1. Creates a Python virtual environment (venv) in this folder.
REM   2. Installs PyTorch with CUDA support (needs an NVIDIA GPU + a
REM      recent driver) and the rest of the requirements.
REM   3. Creates images_out\ for finished pictures.
REM
REM What it does NOT do:
REM   - Download the Kandinsky model weights. Diffusers downloads the
REM     prior + decoder (about 8-12 GB total) from Hugging Face on the
REM     first Generate, into the Hugging Face cache on your user
REM     profile -- not into this folder.
REM
REM Requirements: Windows, Python 3.10 or newer on your PATH, an NVIDIA
REM GPU (12 GB recommended), about 20 GB free disk. Everything here is
REM free -- no account, no payment, no server.
